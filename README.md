About Me

I am a cloud DevOps engineer  diving deep into the intersection of:

**Linux** Administration for rock-solid infrastructure.

**DevOps** to build scalable, automated, and high-availability systems

**Cloud Computing** for modern, on-demand architecture.

**Cybersecurity** to defend against threats and enforce compliance.

**Artificial Intelligence** to bring intelligence into IT operations (AIOps)

Currently working on:
CI/CD Pipelines with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Docker.

Securing Linux servers using CIS Benchmarks & ISO 27001 standards.

Threat detection & hunting using Elasticsearch & Kibana.

Deploying containerized apps using Kubernetes.

Exploring AIOps use-cases in cloud infrastructure.
